Cabinet politics in Africa is often portrayed as a strategic power-struggle between rulers and elites. This project provides the first comprehensive analysis of how African rulers approach cabinet politics and how their strategies of elite management influence their survival in office. For the empirical analysis I compiled a database of cabinet politics in Africa. It contains information on the appointment, dismissal, and rearrangement of ministers, along with minister's time in office and the size of the cabinet for more than 200 rulers that governed in 40 African states covering the time period from independence of each state until 2020.
